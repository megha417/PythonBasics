# Let's store a string (string = any kind of text) in a variable. In the following example, 'dummy' is a variable which holds some text data (string) 
# Use print() to print something (it's not necessary in google colab, but tag along with us here for now)

dummy = "Hello world!"
print(dummy)

# check the data type of variable 'dummy'
print(type(dummy))

# explore other data type quickly before focusing our attention to strings

num = 3
another_num = 3.0
print(type(num))
print(type(another_num))

val = True
print(type(val))

# Let's just print the actual values 

print(num)
print(another_num)
print(val)
